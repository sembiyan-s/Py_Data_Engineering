1. What is Pandas?
    Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data analysis and manipulation.

2.What is a DataFrame in Pandas?
    A DataFrame is the core data structure in Pandas, used to store tabular data (like an Excel sheet or SQL table).

3.Key Points About DataFrame

        1. 2D structure
                Rows x Columns

        2.Think of it as a table with labeled rows and columns.
            Labeled axes

        3.Columns have names (labels)
            Rows have index numbers (can be custom too)

        4.Heterogeneous data allowed
            Each column can have different data types (int, float, string, etc.)

        5.Column operations are easy
            You can select, rename, delete, or add new columns easily.

4.Built-in functions
    Statistical summaries, sorting, filtering, merging, group-by, pivoting, etc.

5.Data import/export
    Easily read/write to CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.

| Pain Point        | Description
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------
Manual Looping      |    You have to manually loop through both tables
A Verbose           | Code becomes long and repetitive
Hard to Read        | Hard to debug or maintain
Slower              | Not optimized for large data sets
No Flexibility    |Hard to do other joins like 'left', 'outer, right without extra code
